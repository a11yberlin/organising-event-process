# A11y Meetup Process

> First draft, still work in progress ðŸš§

## Pre-event tasks

There are several goals before having the event. First, is to reach and confirm the speakers for the next edition if we donâ€™t have any talk proposals received. In case we have talk proposals, we have to review them and respond to the potential speakers. Itâ€™s nice if we can contact them as a form of confirmation and welcoming them. This part can be also automated.

As part of the communication with potential speakers, we have to confirm a date that will be fine for all of the selected people for the next event. This same date needs to be double checked with the host. In case of mismatch, we have to communicate that with the speakers/host on time.

During the process of reaching companies to host the event or reviewing those that reached us, we should require an accessible entrance elevators, and easy connectivity with the projection system e.g. HDMI output, adapters.

Next step is to arrange the catering if we planned to have one. That might be the same company that we have reached for hosting the event or a different one. The important condition here is to select an inclusive type of food, preferably vegetarian or vegan one.

We also can update at that point our website, publish the event announcement on our meetup/colloq pages, and on our twitter profile. We also need to update our intro slides with the speakers' info, sponsors, and potential announcements.

Finally, we have to be sure that we responded to all questions and requests from speakers. We should send a final email to all selected speakers with all details e.g. venue address, agenda, additional notes. For an email, template please check the templates section below (TODO will be added later).

## On-event tasks

The important day arrives! There are several key things we have to take care of on that day.

We have to be sure that we have the following resources: name tags stickers for people that are fine or not with photos camera + tripod if we plan to video record the event adapters in case thatâ€™s not provided by the host printed signs and elevator key labels (check templates).

The first thing we have to be sure that we provided correct directional explanations and put all required labels and sign in place.
As soon as the speakers are at the venue we have to check with them the connectivity with the projection system and help them with additional requests like audio output, microphones.

One of us should be responsible to welcome our guest and provide them with a name tag and a photo sticker.
Then we have the opening and our intro presentation in which weâ€™re sharing our code of conduct, speakers, and sponsors.

During the event, someone needs to take good care of our social media presence by posting live updates (e.g. twitter).

Closing notes.

## After-event tasks

Ideally, after the event, weâ€™ll have video recordings with sufficient quality. As a backup variant, we can also record audio from each talk. We have to edit these files, prepare the thumbnails (check the youtube and SoundCloud templates (TODO will be added later)).

Weâ€™re publishing the slides on our website, videos on youtube with links on the website, audio on SoundCloud with links on the website.
Weâ€™re also sharing that info on our twitter account.
For videos, we have to edit also the autogenerated transcripts.
